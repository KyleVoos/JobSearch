TODO:
    1) I should be able to change this from being a class and have everything continue to work correctly with
    less complexity.
    2) Split up find_job_title_indeed() and check_entry_level_job() so the functions are not getting
    job data and filtering job results.
    3) Test to find optimal number of threads to create.
